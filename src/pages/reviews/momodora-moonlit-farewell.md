snippet: Momodora - Moonlit Farewell is less a grand goodbye and more a lackluster handwave
---

Momodora: moonlit farewell sees you follow the journey of Momo as she attempts to stop a demon invasion to her
home village in a classic indie metroidvania adventure.

First impressions are great - the mechanics are tight, pixel art is beautiful and smoothly animated and the story
introduces a rich mythology without getting too bogged down in it.

It gives off a punky, small team vibe reminiscent of cave story - anything could happen simply because the developers
thought it would be cool, and there was no bureaucracy to rein them in.

Unfortunately the first impressions are let down as the game goes on.
It feels like the developers lost willpower or grew bored. Environments start to feel too large and too same-y.
There is a lack of depth to supporting mechanics, like the equippable support buffs and the companions system.
Even the abilities feel a bit lackluster - there are only a handful and they are mostly uninspired fare - double jump,
wall jump and the like.

There is only one ending to the game - which is unusually sparse in a game like this - but not an issue because by the
end the lack of love from the developers had eroded my will to see any more content anyway.

Overall, it is a short experience that is enjoyable but still manages to run out of steam by the end.
