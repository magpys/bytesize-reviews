snippet: Diablo meets Dead Cells in a slightly lackluster looter
---

Foregone is a love letter to many different games - chiefly Diablo 2 and dead cells.
It combines ideas from these games together into something that is cathartic mindless fun,
but it fails to build its own identity and is unfortunately, ultimately, forgettable.

First impressions, the low-res polygon models draw comparison to dead cells and Diablo 2.
Moment to moment mechanics continue that comparison to dead cells, albeit a bit less polished.

The narrative and tone feel similar to Diablo 2 - like what a teenage boy might consider edgy and cool.
Also like Diablo 2, the story is forgettable and relegated to the background.

Frenetic combat is broken up by collecting loot and occasional jaunts back to a hub area to empty your pockets in
traditional looter game fashion.

The classic looter formula at its core is executed well. Combat is fun enough,
maps and enemies are varied enough and bosses are challenging enough to pull you into a pleasant trance of fight,
upgrade, cash-in, repeat.

But it doesn’t ever build an identity for itself on top of that solid core.
The devs had lots of ideas but instead of picking a couple and refining them, tried to implement all of them.
The result is lots of half finished mechanics that add nothing to the experience.

The overall game is one that is fun while it lasts but I can’t help wishing there was a spark,
something to make it stand out on its own instead of being overshadowed by its influences.
