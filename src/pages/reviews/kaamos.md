Bleak and minimalist, an adventure across a dark Norse land where the sun set and never rose again.

A rare good mobile game - it twists the classic mobile tile matching mechanic into something methodical and wraps it
with roguelike progression.

Developed by a three-man studio, they embrace their limitations by adhering to an authentic old pixel art style,
minimal backgrounds which combine with the dark tone to make an oppressive, memorable atmosphere that suit the slower,
more tactical twist on the mechanics.

Gameplay is deep enough and variation across runs is enough to keep it fresh for a while, around 20 hours for me.
More late game content, enemy and boss variation and an overarching narrative stretching beyond each individual run
would keep it fresher for longer. The mechanics are plenty deeper than most mobile games though.

Overall, a brilliant first game from a small studio, better than the majority of mobile games out there, well worth your
time.
